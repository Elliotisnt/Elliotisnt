#### PiHole DNS Server on a ThinkPad Yoga 11e (DietPi Linux)

An underpowered school laptop converted into a network-wide ad-blocking, privacy-focused DNS server. It runs Pi-hole (FTL/dnsmasq) for blacklist-based DNS filtering and Unbound for true recursive DNS resolution. DietPi is a super lightweight Debian OS typically used on Raspberry Pi-type computers, but fit well for my DNS server use case.

#### Home-Lab on a 2010 Mac Pro (Linux Mint)

A classic 2010 Mac Pro saved from the scrapyard and repurposed as a Linux Mint server. It hosts a secure, containerized web-and-media platform using Docker with automatic HTTPS, SSO, media organization and backups, LAN file sharing, and self-updating services, all behind a hardened reverse-proxy + auth layer.
