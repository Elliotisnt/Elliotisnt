#### PiHole DNS Server on a ThinkPad Yoga 11e (DietPi Linux)

An underpowered school laptop converted into a network-wide ad-blocking, privacy-focused DNS server. It runs Pi-hole (FTL/dnsmasq) for blacklist-based DNS filtering and Unbound for true recursive DNS resolution. DietPi is a super lightweight Debian OS typically used on Raspberry Pi-type computers, but fit well for my DNS server use case.

#### Docker Media Platform (Secure + Automated) on a 2010 Mac Pro (Linux Mint)

A classic 2010 Mac Pro saved from the scrapyard and repurposed into a secure, containerized media automation platform running Linux Mint. The system uses Docker for streamlined deployment and portability to manage a full set of services, including a hardened reverse-proxy (NGINX + Authelia), automatic HTTPS, and SSO with 2FA. It runs a complete content pipeline (qBittorrent, Gluetun, NZBGet, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr, Prowlarr) for automated personal media processing and metadata management. Encrypted daily backups to Backblaze via rclone, zero-downtime updates via Watchtower, and custom shell scripts for network isolation checks, container health monitoring, and failure alerting make the system fully autonomous, observable, and resilient.
